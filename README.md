# Brick Break
![Welcoming Picture][introPic]


Brick Break is a Java based application that I created for my CS100 final project. It's a version of the classic game where you move a paddle from left to right across the screen to save the ball from plummeting, while also destroying tiles to increase your score. It takes in user input to move the paddle, restart the game, and change the background color. It outputs a window that displays the game field along with all of the objects.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
